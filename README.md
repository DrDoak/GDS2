# Quintessence

You are an A.I, newly created in a top-secret lab. You have the ability to steal and transfer the properties of others. Unsure of the extent of your abilities, or your role in the world, you steal the body and memories of your creator.

Now the entire lab is out to hunt you as you struggle to make it out of the lab alive.

Explore our 2D side-scrolling stages, and use your abilities to overcome overwhelming odds. With these powers, the world becomes your toolset, and your weapon. 

Features original, classic 2D sprite art, matched with modern technology.
